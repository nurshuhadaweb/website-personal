<p>Hye. My name is Nur Shuhada Mammat</p>
<p>I live in Marang, Terengganu</p>
<p>My birthday is on 4 November 1998</p>


<p title= "This is First Paragraph"> hello! my name is Shuhada <br> I enjoy moonlight strolls on the beach,
yellow sunflowers and participation dances. <br> Heheee kidding!! Im not a fan of any of those things(except the yellow sunflowers.
<br> More seriously, my friends would describe me as easy going, funny, good listener,trouble makers and love to nagging them but
sometimes they miss my nag time. </p>

<h1 style="color:blue"> I want to share about 5 ways to heal</h1>



</ul>
     <li> Feel. Show up for the pain. Sit with it. How's your heart? Honor that.</li>
     <li> Be Kind. To yourself as you hurt and heal. To others as they flounder and navigate.</li>
     <li> Connect. Through empathy, story, and hope. Share what hurts and helps </li>
     <li> Cultivate. Make something. Turn your wounds into wisdom or art on purpose. Plant seeds. Test out a new beginning. </li>
     <li> Continue. Keep going. Do what you can. You will envolve. Stay for the miracle. </li>
